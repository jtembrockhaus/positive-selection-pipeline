# Positive Selection Pipeline

## Requirements
This tool was developed and tested on nextflow (22.04.5) and conda (4.14.0).

## Initialization
The pipeline required specific HyPhy scripts. Therefore the git repository [HyPhy standalone analyses](https://github.com/veg/hyphy-analyses) need to be cloned to this project and saved in the folder `ressources/hyphy-analyses`.
```
git clone https://github.com/veg/hyphy.git ressources/hyphy-analyses
```
